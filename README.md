# Udacity-Deep-learning-Foundation

I started on March 23th, 2017, and I completed this Nanodegree on July 25th, 2017.

## PART 1

### Neural Networks

Neural network is the bedrock to deep learning. 

In this section, you’ll learn how it works and test your ability by building a neural network from scratch.

## PART 2

### Convolutional Neural Networks

Convolutional neural network is the standard for solving vision problems. 

It’s used in self driving cars, face recognition, medical imaging, and a whole lot more! 

You’ll learn how this neural network works and apply to a image classification problem.

- Project: Image Classification

## PART 3

## Recurrent Neural Networks

Recurrent neural network is great for predicting on sequential data like music and text. 

With this neural network, you can generate new music, translate a language, or predict a seizure using an electroencephalogram. 

This section will teach you how to build and train a recurrent neural.

## PART 4

### Generative Adversarial Networks

Generative adversarial networks are a type of unsupervised learning where two neural networks compete against each other. 

This is commonly used to generate image data. 

You’ll learn how to build your own generative adversarial network and pit two neural networks against each other.

## PART 1


### LESSON 1: Welcome
Welcome to the Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundations Program! In this lesson, you'll meet your instructors, find out about the field of Deep Learning, and learn how to make the most of the resources Udacity provides.


### LESSON 2: Applying Deep Learning
In this lesson, you'll get your hands dirty by playing around with a few examples of deep learning. Don't worry if you don't understand what's going on! The goal here is just for you to play around with some models others have already created and have fun.


### LESSON 3: Anaconda
Anaconda is a package and environment manager built specifically for data. Learn how to use Anaconda to improve your data analysis workflow.


### LESSON 4: Jupyter Notebooks
Learn how to use Jupyter Notebooks to create documents combining code, text, images, and more.


### LESSON 5: Regression
Learn about linear regression and logistic regression models. These simple machine learning models are the building blocks of neural networks.


### LESSON 6: Matrix Math and NumPy Refresher
In this lesson, you'll review the matrix math you'll need to understand to build your neural networks. You'll also explore NumPy, the library you'll use to efficiently deal with matrices in Python.


### LESSON 7: Intro to Neural Networks
In this lesson, you'll dive deeper into the intuition behind Logistic Regression and Neural Networks. You'll also implement gradient descent and backpropagation in python right here in the classroom.


### PROJECT: Your first neural network
In this project, you'll build and train your own Neural Network from scratch to predict the number of bikeshare users on a given day. Good luck!

## PART 2


### LESSON 1: Model Evaluation and Validation
In this lesson, you'll learn some of the basics of training models. You'll learn the power of testing and cross validation, and some interesting metrics to evaluate models, such as accuracy or R2 score.


### LESSON 2: MiniFlow
In this lesson, you'll build your own small version of TensorFlow, called MiniFlow. By building this, you'll gain an understanding of how TensorFlow works under the hood, and gain more insights into important concepts like backpropagation.


### LESSON 3: Sentiment Analysis with Andrew Trask
In this lesson, Andrew Trask, the author of Grokking Deep Learning, will walk you through using neural networks for sentiment analysis. In particular, you'll build a network that classifies movie reviews as positive or negative just based on their text!


### LESSON 4: Intro to TensorFlow
Vincent Vanhoucke, Principal Scientist at Google Brain, introduces you to deep learning and Tensorflow, Google's deep learning framework.


### LESSON 5
Cloud Computing
Take advantage of Amazon's GPUs to train your neural network faster. In this lesson, you'll setup an instance on AWS and train a neural network on a GPU.


### LESSON 6: Deep Neural Networks
Vincent walks you through how to go from a simple neural network to a deep neural network. You'll learn about why additional layers can help and how to prevent overfitting.


### LESSON 7: Convolutional Networks
Vincent explains the theory behind Convolutional Neural Networks and how they help us dramatically improve performance in image classification.


### LESSON 8: Siraj's Image Classification
Siraj will go over the history of image classification, then he'll dive into the concepts behind convolutional networks and why they are so amazing. He'll also create an Image Classifier for cats & dogs in 40 lines of Python!


### LESSON 9: Weight Initialization
In this lesson, you'll learn how to find good initial weights for a neural network. Having good initial weights can place the neural network close to the optimal solution. This allows the neural network to come to the best solution quicker.


### PROJECT: Image Classification
Classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset using a convolutional neural network.
