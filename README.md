# Udacity-Deep-learning-Foundation

I started on March 23th, 2017, and I completed this Nanodegree on July 25th, 2017.

## PART 1

### Neural Networks

Neural network is the bedrock to deep learning. 

In this section, you’ll learn how it works and test your ability by building a neural network from scratch.

- Project: Your first neural network

## PART 2

### Convolutional Neural Networks

Convolutional neural network is the standard for solving vision problems. 

It’s used in self driving cars, face recognition, medical imaging, and a whole lot more! 

You’ll learn how this neural network works and apply to a image classification problem.

- Project: Image Classification

https://github.com/grapestone5321/dlnd_image-classification

## PART 3

## Recurrent Neural Networks

Recurrent neural network is great for predicting on sequential data like music and text. 

With this neural network, you can generate new music, translate a language, or predict a seizure using an electroencephalogram. 

This section will teach you how to build and train a recurrent neural.

- Project: Generate TV Scripts

https://github.com/grapestone5321/dlnd_tv-script-generation

- Project: Translation Project

https://github.com/grapestone5321/dlnd_language-translation


## PART 4

### Generative Adversarial Networks

Generative adversarial networks are a type of unsupervised learning where two neural networks compete against each other. 

This is commonly used to generate image data. 

You’ll learn how to build your own generative adversarial network and pit two neural networks against each other.

- Project: Generate Faces

## PART 1


### LESSON 1: Welcome
Welcome to the Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundations Program! In this lesson, you'll meet your instructors, find out about the field of Deep Learning, and learn how to make the most of the resources Udacity provides.


### LESSON 2: Applying Deep Learning
In this lesson, you'll get your hands dirty by playing around with a few examples of deep learning. Don't worry if you don't understand what's going on! The goal here is just for you to play around with some models others have already created and have fun.


### LESSON 3: Anaconda
Anaconda is a package and environment manager built specifically for data. Learn how to use Anaconda to improve your data analysis workflow.


### LESSON 4: Jupyter Notebooks
Learn how to use Jupyter Notebooks to create documents combining code, text, images, and more.


### LESSON 5: Regression
Learn about linear regression and logistic regression models. These simple machine learning models are the building blocks of neural networks.


### LESSON 6: Matrix Math and NumPy Refresher
In this lesson, you'll review the matrix math you'll need to understand to build your neural networks. You'll also explore NumPy, the library you'll use to efficiently deal with matrices in Python.


### LESSON 7: Intro to Neural Networks
In this lesson, you'll dive deeper into the intuition behind Logistic Regression and Neural Networks. You'll also implement gradient descent and backpropagation in python right here in the classroom.


### PROJECT: Your first neural network
In this project, you'll build and train your own Neural Network from scratch to predict the number of bikeshare users on a given day. Good luck!
